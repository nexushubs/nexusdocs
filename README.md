# NexusDocs

NexusDocs Server is a storage engine designed for storing public and private files, providing simple
RESTful API to manage. By written in modern javascript (by the power of Babel) and packed with the
popular framework [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), we can take the advantage of
async coding and good concurrent performance.

NexusDocs can be used stand-alone or a proxy to multiple popular cloud storage service,
This could be very helpful when you are going to store files in different cloud service.

It is also integrated with utilities for generating image thumbnail (by high performance image
processing tool [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp)), or converting document files into PDF
(by [unoconv](https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv)).
